<h3>Critical Reading</h3>

    <p>In this course, I learned to apply critical analysis skills to some great works in English Literature. The books we read and discussed in class were: Inferno by Dante, King Lear by Shakespeare, Chronicles by Bob Dylan, and Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.</p>

<h3>English Studies</h3>
    
    <p>In this course, I learned to see English literature as a field that allows us to understand and assess the complexities of human nature. Our studies were mostly focused on Appalachia's coal history and culture, and we read the book Storming Heaven by Denise Giardina.</p>

<h3>Intro Creative Writing</h3>
    
    <p>This course allowed me to flourish as a writer through the practice of writing poetry and short fiction and participating in creative writing workshops.</p>
    
<h3>British Literary History</h3>

	<p>In this course I learned about a diverse range of topics in American literature, spanning several decades. We read famous works such as, Bartleby the Scrivener, The Yellow Wallpaper, and The Sun Also Rises.</p>
    
<h3>Contemporary Poetry</h3>

	<p>In Contemporary Poetry we discussed and studied the movement of language in the works of authors such as, Anne Carson, Elizabeth Bishop, and Robert Hass.</p>
